# HDANYWHERE - MHUB

This app adds support for HDANYWHERE's MHUB multiroom hdtv matrix systems.

## MHUB

Sometimes you'll hear multiroom systems called HDMI over Cat 5e or 6 matrixes.... but that's a really ugly and unintuitive name, so we went with multiroom systems. Watch and control all your HDMI entertainment devices and set top boxes on multiple HDTVs simultaneously using a HDanywhere multiroom system.

## Driver

With this app you can control the inputs and outputs, Send uControl commands (ir) to any input/output or use pronto hex to control your inputs/outputs connected devices.

## Flow Cards:

- Power On/Off Mhub system
- Send uControl command's
- Send pronto HEX ir codes to any of the inputs/outputs.
